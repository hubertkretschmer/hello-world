# hello-world
my first repository on github

Hi.  I am Hubert.  I developed lot's of code (my own text editor, patient administration systems, invoicing applications) to earn my studies about 30 years ago and would like to experiment with cloud and web development to create web shops or data management applications.
I live in Frankfurt am Main/Germany and would also like to become an off-line tutor on Codedoor.
